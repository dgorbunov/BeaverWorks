# BWSI RACECAR 2021
I participated in the Beaverworks Summer Institute's Autonomous RACECAR program over the summer of 2021. These are all the materials from the class.

## [Labs and Notebooks](https://github.com/MITLLRacecar/racecar-daniel-gorbunov)
The completed RACECAR code for all my labs and jupyter notebooks. Holds the Phase 1 Challenge World Record at 12.7 seconds (delimited speed).

## [Grand Prix](https://github.com/MITLLRacecar/racecar-gp3-hot-rods)
The code that won the 2021 RACECAR Grand Prix. The course contains 9 obstacles that all require custom computer vision algorithms to pass as fast as possible. We hold the class record for completing the course in ~170 seconds.

## [Project Apex (F1Sim)](https://github.com/dgorbunov/F1Sim)
Our final 'explore' project for the class: A heavily modified version of the Racecar Simulator Environment with improved tire physics featuring a racetrack and full F1 car model, engine sounds, camera modes, multiplayer, and more. Created to match what we think Autonomous Racing should truly look like.
